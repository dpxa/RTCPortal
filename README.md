# RTCPortal - P2P File Sharing via WebRTC  

RTCPortal is a web-based file-sharing tool that allows users to send files directly to each other using WebRTC and Socket.IO. Unlike cloud storage services, RTCPortal does not store files on a central server. Instead, files are transferred directly between users, making the process private and efficient.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO  
- **Communication:** WebRTC for peer-to-peer file transfer
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages + Render

---

## How RTCPortal Works
RTCPortal uses a signaling server (hosted on Render) to help users find and connect with each other. The signaling server is only used during the connection process. Once a connection is established, files are transferred directly between users through WebRTC. The signaling server does not handle or store any files.

## Planned Improvements  
- **TURN server support** for better connectivity behind firewalls
- **Drag-and-drop file sharing** for a smoother user experience
