# RTCPortal

**Peer-to-Peer File Transfer with WebRTC**

---

## Overview

RTCPortal is a web-based application that provides a platform for peers to exchange files securely using WebRTC and Socket.IO. It was designed to simplify the file-sharing and communication process by not relying on centralized servers for the transfer process. As of now, RTCPortal does not have a public domain; connections are only established through ports opened by the user.

RTCPortal uses a **signaling server** only during the initial connection phase, which allows peers to find each other. 

Once the connection is established, all file transfers occur **directly between users** via WebRTC. This is why the process is **private and decentralized.**

The easy-to-use UI makes it intuitive for any user to share files securely, as no configurations are necessary.
